**1.==**   
equality operator attempts to force its operands to the same type before determining their equality.  
**2.Numbers**  
Unlike most other programming languages, there is no separate integer type, so 1 and 1.0 are the same value.  
**3.String**  
You can define strings in JavaScript by enclosing the text in single quotes or double quotes. For example, 'Our lovely string' and "Another nice string" are both right.  
**4.Length**  
In Javascript we use *.length* to know how many characters are in string.  
**5.===**  
Three equal signs tests if the variable country has both the correct value and also the correct type.
