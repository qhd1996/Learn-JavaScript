**1.==**   
equality operator attempts to force its operands to the same type before determining their equality.  
**2.Numbers**  
Unlike most other programming languages, there is no separate integer type, so 1 and 1.0 are the same value.  
**3.String**  
You can define strings in JavaScript by enclosing the text in single quotes or double quotes. For example, 'Our lovely string' and "Another nice string" are both right.  
**4.Length**  
In Javascript we use *.length* to know how many characters are in string.  
**5.===**  
Three equal signs tests if the variable country has both the correct value and also the correct type.  
**6.Index**  
The first index in an array is 0.  
**7.Higher Order Functions**  
Higher order functions are functions that manipulate other functions. For example, a function can take other functions as arguments and/or produce a function as its return value. Such *fancy* functional techniques are powerful constructs available to you in JavaScript and other
high-level languages like python, lisp, etc.  
**8.Objects**  
In JavaScript objects contain *propertyName : propertyValue* pairs.  
**9.Properities**  
(1)Object's property is a *propertyName : propertyValue* pair, where **property name can be only a string**.If it's not a string, it gets casted into a string.   
(2)You can specify properties when creating an object or later.  
(3)Both *var['propertyName']* and *var.propertyName* are allowed to **get** a property's value.  
(4)Property can be added or changed.  
**10.JavaScript Scope**  
(1)Three are two types of scope:
* Local scope
* Global scope

JavaScript has function scope: Each function creates a new scope.  
**11.Local JavaScript Variables**   
Variables declared within a JavaScript function, become **LOCAL** to the function.  
Local variables have Function scope: They can only be accessed from within the function.  
**12.Global JavaScript Variables**   
A variable declared outside a function, becomes **GLOBAL**.  
A global variable has global scope: All scripts and functions on a web page can access it.   
(2)Automatically Global  
If you assign a value to a variable that has not been declared, it will automatically become a **GLOBAL** variable.  
**13.Boolean** 
!: 
If the operand is **null**, the return value is **true**.  
If the operand is **NaN**, the return value is **true**.  
If the operand is **undefined**, the return value is **true**.   
&:
If the operand is **null**, the return value is **null**.      
If the operand is **NaN**, the return value is **NaN**.    
If the operand is **undefined**, the return value is **undefined**. This will cause an error.  
&:  
If the operand is **null**, the return value is **null**.        
If the operand is **NaN**, the return value is **NaN**.      
If the operand is **undefined**, the return value is **undefined**. This will cause an error.
